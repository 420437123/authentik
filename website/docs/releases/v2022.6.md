## Breaking changes

## New features

-   Added well-known and JWKS URL in OAuth Source

    These fields can be used to automatically configure OAuth Sources based on the [OpenID Connect Discovery Spec](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html). Additionally, you can manually define a JWKS URL or raw JWKS data, and this can be used for Machine-to-machine authentication for OAuth2 Providers.

-   Notifications are no longer created by default

    Instead of creating a Notification with each transport, there is now a new Transport mode called "Local", which locally creates the Notifications. This also adds the ability to customize the notification using a mapping.

-   Database-based sessions

    Sessions have been migrated from the database, where as they previously were stored in the cache. This has a slight performance hit, however fixes random issues cause by non-atomic session changes.

-   MFA Validation threshold has been migrated to signed cookies

    Last MFA validation is now saved in a signed cookie, which changes the behavior so that only the current browser is affected by MFA validation, and an attacker cannot exploit the fact that a user has recently authenticated with MFA.
